			<h2>Conlusion</h2>
<p>In our project, we delved into the analysis of movie synopses and dialogues across different rating categories, aiming to gain insights into the preferences of audiences with varying tastes. Through our exploration, we noticed distinct patterns in the thematic elements present in movies of different ratings.</p>
<p>In lower-rated movies, we observed a main focus on plot-driven narratives characterized by intense and direct themes. Keywords such as 'dead', 'king', and 'killer' frequently appear in the synopses and dialogues of these films, indicating a penchant for high-stakes storytelling and dramatic twists. These movies often center around gripping plotlines and suspenseful sequences that captivate audiences with their fast-paced narratives.</p>
<p>Conversely, higher-rated movies exhibited a tendency to explore more nuanced themes and depict vivid environments that contribute to a rich storytelling experience. Concepts like 'creature', 'workers', and 'chance' were prominently featured, suggesting a broader scope of storytelling that extends beyond the immediate plot. These films pay meticulous attention to world-building and character development, creating immersive environments that resonate with audiences on a deeper level.</p>
<p>This differences in thematic focus implies that lower-rated movies prioritize narrative intensity and immediate conflict resolution, whereas higher-rated movies emphasize the art of storytelling through immersive world-building and intricate character dynamics.</p>
<p>Through our analysis and synthesis of these insights, we shed light on the underlying factors that contribute to the perceived quality of movies across different rating categories. By understanding these nuances, filmmakers and storytellers can tailor their creative endeavors to cater to the diverse preferences of audiences, ultimately enhancing the overall cinematic experience.</p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>There is certainly many aspects that could be improved. We could dived deeper into the source of data to determina how Cenimagoer actually decides on their data collection (as a point out in Proejct Data Collection), we could utilize some unsuperivised ML algorithms such as KNN or K-Means to try visaulzaiing the potenial clustring structure of these movies in terms of ratings, release year, and votes to help support our goal in the first place.</p>

			<h2>Dialogues Data:</h2>
<p>With TfidfVectorizer(max_df=.8, min_df=0.05, stop_words='english', lowercase=True), we gain the most frequent unique words in the conversation data from these movies across different ratings and visualize the first 200 words.</p>
<p><img alt="conver-low" src="images/conver-low.png"></p>
<p>For these low rating (2.5~6.6) movies, there seems to be a frequent appearance for movie conversations involving 'agent', 'bomb', 'chase', and 'president', 'princess', and 'museum', depicting an action movie on thriller and adventure.</p>
<p><img alt="conver-med" src="images/conver-med.png"></p>
<p>For these medium raing (6.7~7.6) movies, there seems to be more appearances for movies conversations involving 'captain', 'emperor', 'king', and 'leads', 'professor', and 'policeman', pointing more to the power dynamic in people's conversations and some storis of musical and history.</p>
<p><img alt="conver-high" src="images/conver-high.png"></p>
<p>For these high raing (7.7~9.2) movies, there seems to be a lot of overlapping with the medium rating movies with some new terms such as 'senator', 'tank', and 'taxi', which coincide with our later Cosine Similarity Analysis where highly rated and medium rated movies share a higher similiarity with terms with a TF-IDF score of &gt; 0.5 (0.022308149910767405) than the other two groups (0.019886363636363636, 0.018229166666666668).</p>
<h2>Synopsis:</h2>
<p><img alt="conver-low" src="images/syn-low.png"></p>
<p>For these low rating (2.5~6.6) movies, there seems to be a frequent appearance for movies involving 'bond', 'emterprise', 'nuclear', and 'fbi', 'killer', depicting an action movie on thriller and adventure and consistent with our conlusin above.</p>
<p><img alt="conver-med" src="images/syn-med.png"></p>
<p>For these medium rating (6.7~7.6) movies, there seems to be more appearances for movies involving 'computer', 'money', 'evil', and 'professor', 'cia', 'lieutenant', emphasizing more on horror and suspense movie genres.</p>
<p><img alt="conver-high" src="images/syn-high.png"></p>
<p>For these high raing (7.7~9.2) movies, there seems to be more appearances for movies involving 'creature', 'chance', 'alien', 'memories', and 'workers', 'prisoners'. Meanwhile in terms of movie genres, documentary in medium ratings movies was replaced by film-noir in high ratings, indicating a topic preferences in these concepts and the film-noir genre. However, film-noir actually also appears in the low ratings genre, this could show that film-noir has a really polarized views among audiences. </p>

			<h2>EDA Summary:</h2>
<p>The EDA examines variables like ratings, year of release, and number of votes. Key statistical methods include descriptive statistics and plotting with bar plots, scatter plots, and graphs to explore how certain factors change over time. The dataset is cleaned by converting the 'release_year' column to numeric and dropping rows with missing values. The shape of the cleaned dataset is analyzed, along with descriptive statistics and correlations among numeric variables such as 'release_year', 'rating', and 'votes'.</p>
<p><img alt="outlier1" src="images/outlier1.png">
<img alt="outlier2" src="images/outlier2.png">
<img alt="outlier3" src="images/outlier3.png"></p>
<p>The year and votes sbow relatively more outliers compared to ratings, which makes sense since ratings have a much more dense numeric range than the other two.</p>
<p><img alt="pairplot" src="images/pairplot.png"></p>
<p>There is no obvious linear trend between most of these numeric variable pairs, but let us take a deeper look into votes v.s. ratings.</p>
<p><img alt="lmplot" src="images/lmplot.png"></p>
<p>There seems to be a relativey positive trend between these two, which means that great movies tend to have more votes.</p>

			<h2>Collection:</h2>
<p>Our main data is from the <a href="https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/movie.html">Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus</a>, which is a large metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts. It includes 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters in 617 movies from 1927 – 2009 and the movie metadata includes genres, release year, IMDB rating, and number of IMDB votes of a movie.
Another source of information is the <a href="https://cinemagoer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Cinemagoer</a> library mainly providing the synopsis, reviews, and intro data for each movie from IMDb, the library provides easy access to diverse information on movies with their IMDb ID. </p>
<h2>Limitations:</h2>
<p>We have to point out some of the limitations of these data collection. For the Cornell data, the issue is that these movies are relatively out-of-date, which means that they are not recently produced, could not represent what people nowadays think of the film industry. Also, the data is only from 1927 – 2009, relatively short in terms of period.
For the Cinemagoer data scraped from IMDb, the issue is that we do not know how the library decides which data to collect which to not. Is it based on which one shows up first on the website? Or is it based on something else like likes or votes for comments? The library also provides multiple versions of information in terms of synopsis and introductions data of a movie, we also do not have access to how the library decide which version go first and we just chose the one appear first when accessing.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<h2>Intro:</h2>
<p>According to Bleichenbacher (2012), “Hollywood movies have been a prime site for the representation of intercultural and multilingual encounters for decades. As such, they are not only of interest to everyday cinemagoers or home viewers, but have increasingly attracted the attention of scholars from various disciplines.” To dive deeper into such interaction between movies and representation of culture, we aim to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to explore the dialogues and synopsis data from movie scripts for differently rated movies (2.5~6.6 / 6.7~7.6 / 7.7~9.2) in the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus data. In our project, we assess a movie’s success by its IMDb ratings obtained from the Cinemagoer python library wrapped around IMDb’s API. We conduct this project to gain a more recent understanding of the public’s tastes in films. 
In terms of Film Studies, the project contributes by providing insights into what unique terms appear in the dialogues and synopsis data for different ratings, and a thus discussion on how audience preferences and definitions of great films (in terms of ratings) change over time. In terms of Computing in the Humanities, the project could serve as a computational methods to understand the public’s taste for films across years and ratings, providing an aspect into our culture and art in this society.</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>We will first explore the basic traits of films such as release year, rating, and votes of each and do some exploration on the distribution of these figures of a movie to obtain some understanding of our movie data. After that, we conduct some TF-IDF analysis from the dialogues and synopsis data and try to gain some insights from their shared similarities or differences on topics, plots, and genres, obtaining some comprehension on what makes a great movie in terms of their plots. Most of the results will be represented with plots and graphs, with interpretation markdowns alongside explaining and discussing any discoveries from them.</p>
